    <h1>Casey Hunt (she/her)</h1>
    <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Casey! I am a second year PhD Student at the <a>THING Lab in the ATLAS Institute</a>. Here, I design and build networked <span id="tangible">tangible</span> and <span id="embodied">embodied</span> interaction systems. In my work, I explore how we can better create and connect using systems that
de-center and supplement traditional 2D interaction. Because I am passionate about bringing these questions to the wider community, I expand access to these technologies with <span id="toolkits">toolkits</span> and <span id="participatory">participatory design practices</span>. </p>
